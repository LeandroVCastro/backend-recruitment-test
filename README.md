# Backend Recruitment Test

This is the `backend` boilerplate for the test to join the Hubs Contabilidade Technology Team. Welcome!

The purpose of this test is to assess your logical reasoning ability, as well as your backend coding skills, structuring relationships between entities, system integrations, code organization, creativity, independence, and problem-solving.

## The challenge

A customer has requested a very simple `enterprises` management system. Your role is to structure a CRUD-type interface that allows `enterprises` to be retrieved, registered, modified and removed from the system. Once this structure is complete, integrate the system with a simple `frontend` application. You will find the `frontend` boilerplate [here](https://github.com/hubs-contabilidade/frontend-recruitment-test). This integration is only required for FullStack Engineering roles. Make sure to check this out before you start to code anything.

### Important notes

- The `enterprise` entity must have at least one relationship with a second entity of your choice;
- To make the process easier for you, we have provided a `migration` and a `schema` that represent the base `enterprise` entity;
- The application is configured to serve information using `GraphQL` through the `Absinthe` plugin. The entire API interface must be built in the same way.

### What will be evaluated

- The overall organization of your code;
- The technical level of the implementation;
- The level of creativity of the implementation.

### What we don't recommend doing

- Asking someone to code your test for you;
- Using code generated by AI like ChatGPT or Gemini (we want to evaluate your skills, not the AI's);
- Changing the scope of the project too much.

### What we would like to see

- Unit and E2E tests;
- Using asynchronous jobs and/or queues to handle stuff;
- Integration with external APIs;
- Audit logs;
- The application deployed on AWS (preferred) or any other cloud service.

> Please keep in mind that weâ€™re not evaluating whether you can build up an application with a million complex features. Do what you can within your available time. However, remember that the more things you can show, the more points your test will potentially earn.

If you're struggling, read the documentation for [Elixir](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.18.1/introduction.html), [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.html), [Absinthe](https://hexdocs.pm/absinthe/), and [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html). You will find many answers there (I mean really, these docs are top tier).

## Deadline

We expect you to finish your code within `1 week` from the day you received the test.

The rest is up to you! Good luck!

## General setup instructions

> To run this test, we assume you already have `Docker`, `Elixir` and some `DBMS` installed on your machine. If not, you'll need to figure out how to set this up yourself first.

To start your `Phoenix` server:

- Fork and clone this repository so you can version your changes;
- Run `docker-compose up database` to setup the database container;
- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies, and to run the available migrations;
- Start the application endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`;
- Load the database dump available at `assets/enterprises.sql` to your local database;
- Now you can consume the API through [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your preferred GraphQL client.
